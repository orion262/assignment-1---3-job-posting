# assignment-1---3-job-posting

Wk 1 assignment 3 covers open source jobs

How do the results compare between job search results for "arcgis server" vs. "geoserver"? Discuss your findings with respect to number of jobs, salaries, and types of jobs. Be aware of jobs that are tagged as "sponsored" 7 pts.

When i compare to categories for nationwide job listings, there was a big difference in job results. The two categories differed if the position was remote or not, salary and the amount of listings and tiles. The Geoserver mostly had postions labeled as certain engineer and had 76 jobs results with 8 offers to work from home. Even though the Geoserver job search had few listings, it had salary ranges from 80k to 150k. The ArcGIS server search found 659 postings had a wider range of salary from 40k year to 115k a year with a greater amount of positions that were able to work remote,87. This search mostly pertained to titles such as technician, technologys, specialist and analyst.

Look through the class syllabus and search for additional technologies and compare the job search results to searches with similar software you know (e.g., arcgis vs. qgis, sde vs. postgis, arcgis javascript vs. openlayers or leaflet 7 pts.

When comparing arcgis vs. qgis, the first thing we are able to see is the amount of postings. ArcGIS recieves 3734 postings, while QGIS recieves 347 postings. If we look at the titles we can notice that they are also relatively similar, and the same posting appears in both searches. From what salary ranges we are able to see, we can note that salaries for both are about the same as well.

Perform similar searches as above but add "git" or "docker" to the search query. How does that change the search results? 7 pts

When looking up listings for "git" we find 31,518 job postings. Although, these positions may look like random titles but they all have a similarity of "git" in them. This could be the word digital, github or other. Some professions do pull up for GITHub experience. When the listings for docker is looked up, we see 26,182 listings. This search brings us alot of software engineer and computer technician listings. A lot of these computer/software base listings are looking for alot of strong programing foundations.

Assume you have acquired the skills listed in the syllabus. Find one job advertisement that you would not have otherwise found or realized you were qualified for. Describe why that job is interesting to you and why it would not have been on your radar previously.

The skill that i would choose is QGIS. A job that I found interesting was a Data Scienctist doing remote sensing work. I thought this one was quiet interesting because of the high resolution datasets to gather information on of estimated number, species and size of trees across the continental United States. The company Silvia Terra, is also focusing on their developing and improving metrics such as biodiversity indices, harvest likelihood, etc. based on these data.
